# "Flight Delay Analysis" <br>
"Analyzes flight delays to identify peak times contributing factors" <br>
The Flight Delay Analysis project is a web-based application designed to help users analyze and explore flight delays at major airports. The project provides a simple interface to filter flight data by airport and year, visualize trends, and gain insights into factors affecting flight schedules. <br>

Features :- <br>
- Data Filtering: Select specific airports and years to filter flight delays. <br>
- Dynamic Data Table: Displays filtered flight data in a responsive table format.<br>
- Charts and Visualizations: Placeholder for generating interactive charts (e.g., average delays per airport). <br>
- Responsive Design: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices. <br>

You’ll need the following tools to run the project :- <br>
- A web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.)<br>
- A code editor (VSCode, Sublime Text, etc.)<br>
<br>
EXECUTION STEPS :-<br> <br>
- Clone or download the project repository.<br>
- Install required tools and libraries.<br>
- Download the dataset and place it in the appropriate folder.<br>
- Preprocess the dataset to clean and organize data.<br>
- Perform exploratory data analysis to identify patterns and trends.<br>
- Visualize data insights using graphs and charts.<br>
- Train the machine learning model using the prepared dataset.<br>
- Evaluate the model’s performance on test data.<br>
- Deploy the project (if applicable) for user interaction.<br>
- Document results and prepare for final presentation.<br>
<br>
Attributes :- <br>
- flightNumber: The flight's unique identification number. <br>
- origin: The airport where the flight originates. <br>
- destination: The airport where the flight is heading. <br>
- delay: The delay time in minutes. <br>
- date: The date of the flight (format: YYYY-MM-DD). <br>
<br>
Technologies Used :- <br>
- HTML: The markup language used for the structure of the webpage. <br>
- CSS: Styling language for creating a responsive and modern design. <br>
- JavaScript: Handles the logic for filtering flight data and dynamically updating the page. <br>
- Chart.js (Optional): A library for creating interactive charts and visualizations. <br>
- Font Awesome: Used for icons. <br>
