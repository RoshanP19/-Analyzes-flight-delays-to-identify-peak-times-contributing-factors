"Analyzes flight delays to identify peak times contributing factors"
To analyze flight delays effectively, identify peak times, and understand the contributing factors, we can take a structured approach that involves gathering data, performing analysis, and visualizing the results. Here's how to break down the task:
GROUP MEMBERS :-
→ Panchal Roshan   [ID :- KU2407U365]
→ Aksh Patel       [ID :- KU2407U250] 
→ Neer Patel       [ID :- KU2407U347]
→ Neel Sewani      [ID :- KU2407U338]

Features :-
→ Data Filtering: Filter flight delays by airport and year.
→ Dynamic Table: View filtered flight data in a responsive table.
→ Charts and Visualizations: Placeholder for generating interactive charts (e.g., average delays per airport).
→ Responsive Layout: Works on both desktop and mobile devices.

Project Structure :- 
 The project consists of the following files:

→ index.html: The main HTML structure for the webpage.
→ style.css: Styling for the webpage and its elements.
→ script.js: JavaScript to handle data filtering, dynamic table population, and interactive elements.
→ README.md: This file.

Technologies Used :-
→ HTML: Markup for the structure of the webpage.
→ CSS: Styling for a modern, responsive design.
→ JavaScript: Logic to manage the data and create dynamic interactions.
→ Chart.js: For visualizing flight delay data (optional).
